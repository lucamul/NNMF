# NNMF

This folder contains the code for Non-Negative Matrix factorization. In this project we worked on optimizing the NNMF code by applying some techniques such as vector,
instructions, blocking for cache and registers etc.

All the code can be found in src, specifically the main file can be used to run all the experiments. 
A report is found in the codebase which outlines the results of the project.
